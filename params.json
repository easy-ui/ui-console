This project is under work and maybe there some bug. I made\r\nthis tool for my own use at the beginning and I thought it might be\r\nuseful to other people too.\r\n\r\nWith `uiconsole` you run on remote devices (Android, IOS, Computer ...) [Firebug lite](https://getfirebug.com/firebuglite), [WEINRE](http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre/docs/latest/Home.html), [GREMLIN.JS](http://grml.in/)\r\n\r\nYou are able to take a Screenshot of the current web page too. This is possible with the [html2canvas](http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/documentation.html) library.\r\n\r\nThere is a JSCONSOLE, which allows you to send javascript commands to the target Web page.\r\n\r\nYou can also define commands javascript to run tests simultaneously on your different devices.\r\n\r\nThis is very useful when you need to see a page rendering on different devices, phone, tablet or computer at the same time. Need to enter the same login passwords on all devices, a real time saver.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nInstall this globally and you'll have access to the `uiconsole` command anywhere on your system.\r\n\r\n    npm install -g uiconsole\r\n    \r\n    \r\n**Usage**\r\n=========\r\n\r\n - Create a folder.\r\n\r\n        mkdir uiconsole\r\n        cd uiconsole\r\n\r\n - Start 'uiconsole' and a web server and a socket server run on port 8080.\r\n \r\n        uiconsole\r\n    \r\n - A small SQLite database is created for user management. The default account is 'admin' for the User name and 'password' for password.\r\n - Weinre is started on port 8282\r\n\r\n - Open your browser for access to the `uiconsole`.\r\n\r\n        http://< your_ip >:8080\r\n     \r\n - Then add this code on your target web page:\r\n\r\n        <script src=\"http://<your_ip>:8080/socket.io/socket.io.js\"></script>\r\n        <script>\r\n        if(typeof io != 'undefined'){\r\n            var socket = io.connect('http://<your_ip>:8080');\r\n            socket.on('connect', function(){console.log('CLIENT socket.on: connect');socket.emit('connect', {data: navigator.userAgent});});\r\n            socket.on('jscmd', function(data){try{eval(data.cmd);}catch(error){console.log(error);}});\r\n        }\r\n    </script>\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://getfirebug.com/firebuglite\r\n  [2]: http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre/docs/latest/Home.html","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
